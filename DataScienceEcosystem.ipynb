    "Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python**: Widely adopted for its simplicity, extensive libraries (such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn), and versatility in data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R**: Commonly used for statistical analysis and data visualization, R is favored in academia and research-oriented data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: Essential for database management and querying. Data scientists often use SQL to extract and manipulate data stored in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Julia**: Known for its high-performance computing capabilities, Julia is gaining popularity in data science, especially for tasks involving large datasets and complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scala**: Often used in conjunction with Apache Spark for big data processing and analytics, Scala is a versatile language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n"
